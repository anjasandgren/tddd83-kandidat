            <li>This is a service for Linköping University's students and teachers! 
                Therefore, you need to be associated with Linköping University to use KaffeKuriren.</li>
            <li>To put an order, you pay an extra fee of 7 SEK for each item which is the reward to your deliverer - a coffee as thanks!</li>
            <li>This is a system where students can help each other. If something however would happen to your order or when you deliver, the cost is shared between both parties.
